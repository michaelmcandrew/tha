<p>Some of the options that you can set are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Link weight</dt>
  <dd>This will be used as the weight of the menu items if specified. If you want your menu items to be in the same order as they are in the view, add the 'Global: View result counter' field, and set the option to that field. You can then use all of the sorting options within views to order your items.</dd>
</dl>
